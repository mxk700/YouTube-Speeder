#### Advanced YouTube Speed Manager
Watch your sport, games, news, tutorials, foreign language lessons, etc. with handy speed controller.

##### How does it work?
Content script is run in every tab you open and in every iframe of the tab. The script searches for YouTube videos and embeds there block with Speeder controls.

##### Use and controls
With The YouTube Speeder you've dreamed about you can set playback speed using:
###### Mouse:
  - wheel;
  - click on slider range;
  - click on orange arrows within the slider;
  - click and hold on orange arrows within the slider;
  - click on rounded orange square within the slider to set speed to default;

###### Keyboard:
To use keyboard, mouse pointer should be hovered over the slider block  (the latest becomes a little bit brighter). Placing mouse pointer over the slider block also prevents YouTube top and bottom panels from hiding. In this mode you can use the next keys:
  - speed up: Right Arrow, Up Arrow, + button;
  - speed up with acceleration: Page Up;
  - speed down: Left Arrow, Down Arrow, - button;
  - speed down with acceleration: Page Down;
  - maximal value: End;
  - default value: Home, Space, Enter, Escape.
  - minimal value: Delete;

###### Acceleration Mode.
Allows you to change speed a little bit quicker.
Press and hold "Ctrl" key to engage this Mode, then use:
  - mouse wheel;
  - keyboard arrows;
  - the slider control elements;

When accelerated, speed change step is multiplied by the value set in Options as "Speed multiplier". Presets: step = 0.1, multiplier = 5. This means that speed changes for 0.1 per click or keydown in normal mode and for 0.5 per the same action when accelerated.
Pressing Page Up or Page Down also changes speed value by 0.5.

##### Options
You also can adjust The YouTube Speeder settings for your convenience.
To get to the Options Page go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/), find this Extension, click on "Details" button, then find "Extension options". In the Options Page you can set minimal, maximal and default speed value, as well as some others parameters.
