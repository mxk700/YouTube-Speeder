  Nowadays there is vast variety of different kinds of food. In most countries
people can voluntarily chose what they eat, it is their choice should it be
something tasty, cheap or healthy.
  Unlike adults, in most cases children aren't rational when it is speaking
about food. Without strict control they are keen to eat the most tasty and at
the same time most harmful products like candies, ice-cream, cola, chips etc. So it
is pretty apparent that someone else has to teach young people right food habits.
The question is who should be responsible for this duty?
  The first big group insists that teachers have to do this. Indeed, teachers are
professionals and they know how to provide effectively some point of view to children.
Another profitable side of this approach is that teachers can be given a special
program developed by doctors.
